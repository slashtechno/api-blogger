# type is a required field that specifies the type of the source or destination.
# name is the name of the source or destination. It is ud to refer to the source or destination when running the command.
# overwrite is a boolean field that specifies whether to overwrite the file/post if it already exists. This is done by removing old files/posts that have the same title.
# blog_url is the URL of the blog
# content_dir is the directory where the markdown files are located
# git_dir, if set, will be used to push files to a Git repository. Normally, if you're running something like Hugo, this would be the root directory of your Hugo site (the top-level directory that contains .git)
# frontmatter_mapping is a table that can be used to customize the frontmatter (metadata). This is useful if your Hugo theme uses different frontmatter keys or if it's a frontmatter key that's not "officially" supported by Hugo and it's up to the theme to decide what key to use. I use Hugo as an example but in reality, this option could probably be used to make this compatible with any static site generator that uses frontmatter.
# generate_llm_descriptions is used to utilize Large Language Models to generate descriptions for Blogger posts as they don't have a description field accessible via the API.
